# Operations Research Project - Jupyter Notebook Solutions - ECE AUTH

This repository contains my solutions to a university assignment for the course **Operations Research**, completed during the Summer Semester of 2024. All solutions are implemented and documented using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents

The repository includes:
- A well-documented Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the modeling and solution of two optimization problems.
- Code implementations using Python libraries (such as gurobi and numpy) for mathematical modeling and optimization.
- Mathematical formulations, problem constraints, and objective functions for clarity.
- Results and visualizations illustrating the solutions.

## Topics Covered

The assignment focuses on the following topics:

### 1. Airport Landing Schedule Optimization
- Formulates a scheduling problem for landing times of aircraft.
- Minimizes penalties for early or late landings.
- Incorporates constraints such as minimum time between landings, earliest and latest allowable landing times, and estimated arrival times.

### 2. Oil Delivery Routing Problem
- Models a vehicle routing problem for delivering oil to various cities.
- Minimizes the total distance traveled while satisfying city demands and vehicle capacity constraints.
- Incorporates flow constraints, vehicle starting/ending conditions, and capacity restrictions.
